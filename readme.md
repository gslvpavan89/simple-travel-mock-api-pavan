 Import the project into any ide
 run Bootstrap.java file
 Then the boot app will be up and running
 
 Also Ui app is available in \src\main\webapp
 build.gradle file contains tasks to package frontend build and put it in folder build\resources\main\static
 when we start the spring boot jar it will automatically start boot app which also contains ui app.
 But due to some issues from the combined app i am unable to visit ui pages
 
 Please check the file travel-api.docx to see the final artifact screenshots.
 
 Standalone ui project is available in below github page
